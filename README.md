# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals-with-ML

## Project Description

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I will build a credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. 

While building this credit card predictor, I tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as scaling, label encoding, and missing value imputation. I finished with some machine learningto predict if a person's application for a credit card would get approved or not given some information about that person.
 
#### For this project I used Python. Packages used: Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn.

## Analysis is in the Jupyter Notebook "notebook.ipynb".

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
